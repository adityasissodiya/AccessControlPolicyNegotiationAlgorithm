abstract: >-
  Managing access control within digital ecosystems presents
  unique challenges, particularly regarding policy
  negotiation among diverse stakeholders. This paper
  introduces a novel algorithm based on game theory and
  objective optimization to facilitate consensus on access
  control policies, ensuring equitable data access while
  safeguarding confidentiality and compliance. Through a
  systematic approach, we demonstrate the efficacy of our
  model in balancing competing objectives and streamlining
  policy negotiation processes, thereby enhancing the
  operational efficiency and trust within digital
  ecosystems.
